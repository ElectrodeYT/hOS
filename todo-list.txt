hos todo:
// - figure out why mlibc ctors dont work (calls to null after linker calls _start)
- figure out why the GOT is zeroed (something to do with mlibc dynamic linking not relocating the JUMP_SLOT bits)
- make VFS better (can at least reduce code waste by making some many used things into functions)
- rewrite scheduler (slow, shit)
- rewrite interrupt system (slow, slightly less shit than scheduler)
- rewrite timer system (barely works, uses PIT, basically just about good enough for scheduler)
